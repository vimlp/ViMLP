# ViMLP - Vietnamese Minority Languages Preservation

ViMLP (Vietnamese Minority Languages Preservation) is a pioneering initiative aimed at preserving and revitalizing minority languages in Vietnam through state-of-the-art speech-to-text translation works. This project introduces a comprehensive dataset and methodology for direct speech-to-text translation. Initially, we work on the Muong language - one of Vietnam's significant minority languages without a standardized writing system.

The code and data will be published soon when our paper get accepted at INTERSPEECH 2025.
