# ViMLP - Vietnamese Minority Languages Preservation

ViMLP (Vietnamese Minority Languages Preservation) is a pioneering initiative aimed at preserving and revitalizing minority languages in Vietnam through state-of-the-art speech-to-text translation works. This project introduces a comprehensive dataset and methodology for direct speech-to-text translation. Initially, we work on the Muong language - one of Vietnam's significant minority languages without a standardized writing system.

The code and data will be published soon when our paper get accepted at INTERSPEECH 2025. In the meantime, you can find information about the dataset and some demos of our system at [ViMLP Website](https://vimlp.github.io/).
